# Algorithms Library
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

# Why use this library?

*1*. NO MORE BOILERPLATE CODE - REUSE SEVERAL ALGORITHMS ACROSS DIFFERENT APPS:
        The solved algorithms in here cover several use cases, their number will also increase over time.
        
*2*. CONTRIBUTE / ADD YOUR ALGORITHMS WHERE THEY WILL ALSO GET REVIEWED BY THE COMMUNITY:
        You can add your own algorithms in here, where it could be reviewed / fixed / completed by the community here.
        Then you could reuse it across several apps by implementing this library.

All of the above while:    
        Growing the technical / communicative skills of each individual participating in here making the kotlin community a better place!

So yes....

As stated in my social media ( www.tiktok.com/@innovatony & www.instagram.com/innovatonyy ) :

Let's solve algorithms together!


# How to use this library in your app

**1**. Add the below in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories: (In your project's
build.gradle and if your settings.gradle has repositories{} in it ...)

```	
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
**2**. Add the dependency
   
```
dependencies {
       implementation 'com.github.innovaTony:algorithms:0.0.0'
   }
```

# List of algorithms solved until now:

**Algo 1**. River sizes

**Algo 2**. Words in letter array 

# How to Contribute

You can follow this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML6vfKjQss

or these steps:

**1**. Fork this repo,

**2**. Open in your local machine,

**3**. Create your new branch,

**4**. Do your changes,

**5**. Then push your branch to your forked remote and open a pull request to main branch here. 

Try as much as you can to follow best code practices and to document. 

# Different ways to contribute

**1**. Add : a new algorithm and start solving it

**2**. Modify / Improve : the performance of / correct / refactor  a certain existing algorithm
